<p><u><strong>Northern State University(NSU)</strong></u> is a public university in Aberdeen, South Dakota. NSU is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents and offers 38 majors and 42 minors, as well as six associate, eight pre-professional and nine graduate degrees.</p>
<p>Founded on the intersection of the southern and eastern branches of the Milwaukee Railroad, Aberdeen, South Dakota saw a rapid growth in its population during the late 19th century; this rapid growth led the citizens of northern South Dakota to push for a government-funded institute of higher learning. During the 1885 legislative session a Bill was passed creating what was known at that time as the University of Central Dakota, to be located in the small town of Ordway, South Dakota. However, funds were not approved for the school until the 1887 legislative session. Even though the funds had been approved the bill had been vetoed by Governor Louis K. Church for financial considerations and the statewide lack of support; it would take a few more decades before the school became a reality.

In 1900 Aberdeen had the fastest growing population in northern South Dakota and supporters for the school began to organize in greater numbers. On January 7, 1899, Senator Lawson, often thought to be the father of the Northern Normal and Industrial School, proposed a bill for the creation of the school in Aberdeen; the bill went through many revisions and it would not be until March 2, 1899 that the new school would exist on paper; however both a site and funding were still needed.

Wealthy Aberdonians quickly responded and started to donate their land for the school; responding to the demand to pick a site, the Aberdeen City Council created a committee of twenty-five individuals responsible for choosing the location. The committee was composed of the well-to-do individuals of Aberdeen, including Ira Barnes, W.F.T Bushnell, C.F. Easton, F.W. Brooks, Ed Askew, B.C. Lamont, William Tennant, W.G Bickellhaupt, James Lawson, and Andrew Melgaard. The committee met through most of the early months of 1899 and adjourned in late spring before any decision was made. By late 1899 Governor Andrew E. Lee made the decision to use the land, just south of city limits, donated by Andrew Melgaard; however, the northern border of Melgaard's land did not extend all the way to Twelfth Avenue as Governor Lee had wanted; the land between Melgaard's northern border and Twelfth Avenue was owned by D.C and W.R Thomas of Watertown. In order for the state to receive the land as a donation, the committee had to pay Melgaard and the Thomases for their land. On November 10, the Thomases sold the two half-blocks in question to the state of South Dakota for one dollar and Andrew Melgaard received thirteen hundred for his 20-acre (8.1 ha) plot of land. Now the state was left with the task of funding the construction of the new school.

Approved by Governor Herreid on March 6, 1901, $28,000 was allotted for the construction of the school and an additional $2000 allowed for the building of a heating plant. Under the supervision of the Board of Regents the construction was to be completed and ready for students by September 1, 1902. Additional funding was allotted in yet another legislative bill for expenses such as salaries, lights, fuel, furniture and maintenance; now everything was in place for the creation of Northern Normal and Industrial School.</p>
